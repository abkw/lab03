#' lab3-package: A package for implementing euclidean algorithm and dijkstra algorithm
#'
#' This package provides two categories of important functions:
#' euclidean and dijkstra.
#'
#' @section euclidean functions finds the greates common divisor of two integers and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a graph
#'
#' @section dijkstra function takes a graph and an initial node and calculates the shortest path from the initial node to every other node in the graph.
